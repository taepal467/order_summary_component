## My process
I started off by structuring the content in HTML. Then I used Bootstrap to make the card layout. After doing that, I started playing around with the margins and paddings to get everything in position. I also had to figure out the heights and widths for the card. Then, I began styling the card. My last step was figuring out the background.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

I learned how to create a card using Bootstrap.

### Continued development

I need to get used to using Flexbox and media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me with the card layout.
